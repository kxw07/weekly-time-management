# Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The application has been refactored from a single monolithic `App.vue` component into a modular component-based architecture.

## Component Structure

### Before Refactoring
- **App.vue** (600+ lines) - All functionality in one file

### After Refactoring
```
src/
├── App.vue (330 lines) - Container & business logic
└── components/
    ├── PageTitle.vue - Header section
    ├── TimeTable.vue - Interactive time grid
    ├── TimeSummary.vue - Summary display
    └── Actions.vue - Action buttons
```

## Components Created

### 1. PageTitle.vue
**Purpose:** Display application title
**Props:** None
**Responsibilities:**
- Render centered page title
- Contains own styling

### 2. TimeTable.vue
**Purpose:** Interactive time grid for data entry
**Props:**
- `days` - Array of day names
- `hours` - Array of hour numbers
- `cellData` - Object containing cell content
- `contentColorMap` - Object mapping content to colors
- `selectedCells` - Array of currently selected cells

**Events:**
- `@cell-blur` - Emitted when cell loses focus
- `@selection-start` - Emitted when selection begins
- `@selection-update` - Emitted during drag selection

**Responsibilities:**
- Render time table grid
- Display cell content with colors
- Handle mouse interactions for selection
- Emit events to parent for state changes

### 3. TimeSummary.vue
**Purpose:** Display time allocation summary
**Props:**
- `summary` - Array of summary objects `[{ field, count, color }]`

**Responsibilities:**
- Render summary cards
- Show time counts for each activity
- Apply background colors matching table cells

### 4. Actions.vue
**Purpose:** Action buttons for data management
**Props:** None

**Events:**
- `@export-png` - Export table as PNG
- `@export-json` - Export data as JSON
- `@import-json` - Import data from JSON
- `@clear-all` - Clear all data

**Responsibilities:**
- Render action buttons
- Handle file input for import
- Emit events to parent for actions

## App.vue (Refactored)

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain application state (cellData, contentColorMap, selection state)
- Provide business logic methods
- Coordinate child components
- Handle data persistence (localStorage)
- Manage import/export functionality

**Key Methods Retained:**
- `getCellContent()` - Get content for a cell
- `getCellColor()` - Get color for a cell
- `getAvailableColor()` - Get next available color from palette
- `saveCellContent()` - Save cell content and update colors
- `startSelection()` - Begin area selection
- `updateSelection()` - Update selection during drag
- `endSelection()` - Complete selection and prompt for content
- `updateSelectedCells()` - Calculate selected cell range
- `applyContentToSelection()` - Apply content to all selected cells
- `clearAll()` - Clear all data with confirmation
- `exportToPng()` - Export table as PNG image
- `exportToJson()` - Export data as JSON file
- `importFromJson()` - Import data from JSON file

**Computed Properties:**
- `timeSummary` - Calculate time summary sorted by duration

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a single, clear responsibility
- Business logic separated from presentation
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 2. Reusability
- Components can be reused in other contexts
- Actions component could be used for any data management
- TimeSummary could display any summary data

### 3. Testability
- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- Props and events are clearly defined
- Easier to mock dependencies

### 4. Maintainability
- Smaller files are easier to navigate
- Changes to UI don't affect business logic
- Scoped styles prevent CSS conflicts

### 5. Scalability
- Easy to add new components
- Can split components further if needed
- Clear boundaries for feature additions

## Data Flow

```
App.vue (State Container)
  ├─> PageTitle.vue (Presentation)
  ├─> TimeTable.vue (Presentation + User Input)
  │     └── Events --> App.vue (State Updates)
  ├─> TimeSummary.vue (Presentation)
  └─> Actions.vue (User Actions)
        └── Events --> App.vue (Business Logic)
```

## Props vs Events Pattern

Following Vue best practices:
- **Props down:** Parent passes data to children
- **Events up:** Children emit events to notify parent
- State is managed at the parent level (App.vue)
- Children remain stateless and presentational

## Unit Tests Status

**Note:** Existing unit tests in `src/tests/App.spec.js` will fail after refactoring because:
1. Tests were written against the monolithic component
2. Component structure has changed
3. Internal implementation has changed (methods moved to child components)

**Next Steps for Tests:**
- Create separate test files for each component
- Update App.spec.js to test integration with child components
- Test props, events, and component interactions
- Verify business logic in App.vue still works correctly

## Migration Notes

### Component Registration
All components are locally registered in App.vue:
```javascript
components: {
  PageTitle,
  TimeTable,
  TimeSummary,
  Actions
}
```

### Ref Access
TimeTable component accessed via ref for PNG export:
```javascript
this.$refs.tableContainer.$el
```

### Event Handling
Child components emit custom events that App.vue handles:
```vue
<TimeTable
  @cell-blur="saveCellContent"
  @selection-start="startSelection"
  @selection-update="updateSelection"
/>
```

## File Structure

```

├── src/
│   ├── App.vue (330 lines, down from 600+)
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── PageTitle.vue (20 lines)

```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests (requires Node 18+)
npm test
```

## Future Refactoring Opportunities

1. **State Management:** Consider Pinia/Vuex for complex state
2. **Composables:** Extract business logic into composable functions
3. **TypeScript:** Add type safety to props and events
4. **Component Library:** Create shared component library
5. **Unit Tests:** Update and expand test coverage
6. **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling service
7. **Utility Functions:** Extract color and data manipulation logic
