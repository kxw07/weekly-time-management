This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a weekly time management web application built with Vue 3, designed to be built into static files for easy deployment.

## Project Goals

The application displays a weekly time grid:
- **Rows**: Hours of the day (0-23, representing 24-hour format)
- **Columns**: Days of the week (Sunday through Saturday)
- Users can visualize and manage their time allocation across the week

## Coding Standards

## Project Status

This is an early-stage project. The current phase (Phase 1) focuses on creating the basic time table interface with the week/hour grid structure described above.

## Development Setup

Once the Vue 3 project is initialized, typical commands will include:
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (outputs static files)
